# Handeling sales emails in Notion

Welcome to my project for simplifying email management in Notion! ðŸŽ‰ This project is based on my personal workflow for managing my database with emails and has been a game-changer in streamlining these processes. It has saved me a significant amount of time and effort, allowing me to focus on more meaningful tasks while automating the repetitive ones.

# Background

Description of background to project, that I support the sales team with email. I collect, send and keep track, with the goal to book a meeting.

## Database in Notion

## Workflows

I have mainly 2 workflows in Notion...

### Workflow 1: Adding new emails

I add new emails that I find in forums etc. I add them to the list, only email and company is interesting. 

#### Workflow is kinda like: 
1. Find email in forum that suits the target group
2. Check if email is in database already
3. Add email to database if email isn't already there
4. Add company and select status "Not sent". Leave date and notes empty.

### Workflow 2: Updating existing emails

I update existing emails in the list with a new status, mostly, when I've sent an email or recieved an answer. There are different statuses to choose from. I sent the date when status is changed. I also add notes.

| Status | Description | Tag |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| **Not sent** | Is for... | IMAGE |
| **E-mail 1** | Is for... | IMAGE |
| **E-mail 2** | Is for... | IMAGE |
| **E-mail 3** | Is for... | IMAGE |
| **Meeting** | Is for... | IMAGE |
| **Not Interested** | Is for... | IMAGE |


# Flowchart

I use Notion daily to manage sales emails, which is a part of my role in supporting the sales team. My workflow includes finding emails, sending emails and keeping track of email activity. The ultimate goal of these emails is to help the sales team book meetings for product demos. 

While Notion is an excellent tool for many purposes, it lacks the flexibility and automation I need for these specific tasks. To address this, I built a Python-based solution that integrates seamlessly with Notion, making email management faster, easier, and more reliable.
